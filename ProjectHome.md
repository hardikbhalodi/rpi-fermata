The phone's touchpad presents an open, multi-dimensional entry field. This presents an opportunity for very fine control of audio filters and general manipulation of audio. By streaming audio from a PC over bluetooth radio, this touch control can be integrated cleanly into music production. This project is broken into two tools; the PC side (which will stream to the phone), and the Android side, which will allow the user to manipulate the audio feed, and play it through the phone's default audio output.
